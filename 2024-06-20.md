# 2024-06-20

This document contains the content of the live call from 2024-06-20.

## What did we talk about in the call?

- Python Basics - see the [basics.py](./code/basics.py) file
    - Variables - declaration, definition, usage
    - lists
        - list comprehension
        - list slices & iterators
    - functions vs. methods

## Examples

- Create a list containing the numbers 0-1000
    - Create a list containing only all **even** numbers from 0-1000
    - Create a list containing only all **odd** numbers from 0-1000
    - Create a list of all numbers between 0-1000 that are divisible by 2 & 4 without remainder
        - create a function to create such a list from any number-range passed in via a list

### Practice Ideas

- create a function that receives a list of numbers and returns only elements that can be divided by 3.
- create a function that receives a list of numbers and does the following:
    - print out "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
    - print out "bazz" if the number is divisible by 6
    - print out "buzz" if the number is divisible by 9
    - print out "fizzbazzbuzz" if the number can be divided by all three preceding numbers
    - in any other case: print out the number
- create a function that can count the occurences of a character within a given string
    - the function receives two parameters: 
        1. the character
        2. the string (can also contain whitespaces)
