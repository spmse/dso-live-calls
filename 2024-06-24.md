### 2024-06-24

This document contains all the notes and practice tasks from the live-call on 2024-06-24.

### What did we talk about in the live call?

- Python Programming basics
    - functions:
        - create a filter function for `number` lists
- How to update containers?
    - Image-Versioning and Update-Cycles
    - How can I update my container without loosing data or risking down times?

### Examples

- In the file [code/basics.py](./code/basics.py) you can find a new filter function(s) from line(s) 51 - 91.
    1. iterative approach with for loop and helper variable (54 - 66)
    2. functional approach using filter Higher Order Function (69-73)
    3. functional approach using list comprehension (76-80)

### Practice-Ideas

- create a generator function that receives an `upper_bound` via parameter and returns a list of numbers from a given `lower_bound` (should default to `0`) to the upper bound.
- create different functions that calculate and return:
    1. the amount of a given character in a given string
    1. the amount of whitespaces in a given string
    1. the amount of words in a given string
    1. the amount of a specific given word
- create program that can receive a string and does the following:
    1. it creates a directory (if it does not exist) that is named after the following pattern: `${DATE}-stattrack` where `$DATE` would correspond with the following formatting scheme: `YYYY-mm-dd` -> 2024-06-24
    1. in that directory a sub-directory should be added which is named after a unique ID which will be generated everytime we run the program
    1. in the subdirectory, two files should be created:
        - input-text --> should contain the input text
        - statistics --> should contain your statistical analysis of the text, including:
            - the amount of all vowels, where each vowel is written into one line, like illustrated in the example below<sup>1</sup>
            - wordlist and their occurences

<sup>1</sup>See the codebox below for an example file
```plain
Statistics tracked for ./input-text

Vowels Occurences:

a: 50
e: 800
i: 2
o: 25
u: 4

Word Occurences:

some: 3
orbit: 2
```
