This document is a collection of live call resources that we part of the live call on 2024-07-18.

### What did we talk about in the Call?

- `.gitignore`/ignore-files
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Argparse Development

### Practice Ideas

- build a command line application with argparse that is a light-weight implementation of the `ls` program
    - it should contain a script named `ls.py` that implements a function `ls_entrypoint` which implements the core functions
        - you may use different functions to model to options behaviour
    - it should contain the following options from the original ls implementation:
        - `-a` - lists all files and directories (also the invisible ones)
        - `-l` - the outputs should be formatted in a long version
- build a command line application with argparse that mimicks the behaviour of `tail`. It should implement the following options:
    - `-n` the amount of lines to show
- build a command line application with argparse that mimicks the behaviour of `head`. It should implement the following options:
    - `-n` the amount of lines to show
