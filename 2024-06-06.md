**Problem:** I want to easily connect to various hosts with the same ssh key without having to remember a long command like

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=False \
    -i ~/.ssh/da/id_ed25519 \
    sysops@167.235.153.31
```

**Solution:** 

There are multiple options to solve that challenge:

1. Adjust your ssh-config in order to provide information on how to deal with different hosts and respective identities
1. Add an `alias` for your shell configuration --> potentially requires multiple aliases for different hosts
1. create a reusable workflow
    1. Create a shell-script to solve the challenge
    1. Create a reusable function in your shell configuration that can be used with different hosts
