### Python Functions and Python Programming

In Python you can use functions to abstract code that is executed multiple times into one single reusable snippet that can be shared accross your code base.
Functions can be packaged within modules and thus can be shipped via a package registry so functionality may be preserved throughout multiple projects.

### CLI Applications

CLI stands for Command Line Interface and is a paradigm for software development where an application will not have a graphical user interface (GUI) for users/operators to interact with.
Instead, all interaction will be text/prompt based in a shell-interpreter environment (which is also known as command line interpreter).

`Argparse` is a python module, that helps users to develop small cli application with minimal overhead with input handling since the library provides different components and modules that can be used directly.
